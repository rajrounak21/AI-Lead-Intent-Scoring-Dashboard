#  AI Lead Intent Scoring Dashboard

A web-based lead scoring system that predicts the intent score (0–100) of leads using a machine learning model and a rule-based LLM-style re-ranker.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Problem:** Brokers spend time on low-intent leads, which slows conversions.  
**Solution:** This dashboard prioritizes high-intent leads using predictive analytics and comment-based heuristics.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (minimal JavaScript)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **ML Model:** Scikit-learn's GradientBoostingClassifier
- **Reranker:** Rule-based LLM logic on comment text

---

## 📊 Dataset

- ✅ **Type:** Synthetic (~10,000 rows)
- ✅ **Generated using:** `random`, `numpy`, and `faker`
- ✅ **Fields:**
  - Email
  - Phone Number
  - Credit Score
  - Income
  - Age Group
  - Family Background
  - Occupation
  - Comments

Relationships were designed to simulate real-world lead behavior (e.g., higher income → better credit score).

## 🧠 Model Features

| Feature           | Source     |
|------------------|------------|
| `credit_score`    | Input      |
| `income`          | Input      |
| `age_group`       | Encoded    |
| `family_background` | Encoded |
| `occupation`      | Encoded    |
| `comment_score`   | From LLM reranker (keyword rules) |

---

## 🔄 Comment Score (LLM-style Re-ranker)

Applies rule-based scores:
```
"urgent" → +10
"important" → +5
"call back" → +5
"not interested" → -10
"later" → -5
"follow up" → +5
```
Extracted from the Comments field, passed as a numeric feature (`comment_score`) to the model.
